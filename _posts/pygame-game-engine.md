All aspects of this game engine were written completely in Python using the Pygame library, a fairly old but surprisingly robust suite of functions and classes designed for game creation.\

This is an ongoing project, so more content and updates will likely be coming in the future, since this couldn't really be considered a game just yet.\

What's been added so far is functional WASD movement, optimized rendering of objects and players, functional portals that are able to zap you to different maps, and easy to use constructors for maps, portals, objects, and any other entities you wish to make!\

Be sure to check it out!\
