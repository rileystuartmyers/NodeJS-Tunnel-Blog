In order to satisfy my need of feeling like I'm getting things done, I recently got hooked on a few autogrinding games, in which they are specifically designed for you NOT to do anything, and so I developed this C# autoclicker for Windows platforms. This is one of my first fully application-based projects, so I made sure it was extra useful. ;)
