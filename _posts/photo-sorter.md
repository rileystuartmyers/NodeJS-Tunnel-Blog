I've been working on a large machine learning model recently and encountered a pretty significant problem with the dataset of over 10,000 images: it's not sorted at all!

Obviously, this is a big setback as I'd need to sort these photos manually, and with such a large quantity it's bound to take a very long time.

And so, I've developed this software that allows for users to easily and efficiently sort their large collections of photos into neatly labeled folders!

By choosing a source and destination directory, users can effortlessly switch between tasks if their images are sorted in different places.

Images are displayed in the center by single-clicking them, and then double-clicking a labeled folder on the right sends the file straight over to its correct place!

Thanks for reading!
